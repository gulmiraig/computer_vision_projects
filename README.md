1. MNIST dataset.
- This is image classification project where Convolutional Neural Network was used.
- Built a model that identifies the class of fashion article based on image. (10 categories of fashion article)

2. CNN_binary_classification_VGG16 

To summary:

- Training was done to small dataset: 2000 pictures belonging to 2 class: cats and dogs
- Comparatively simple model where 4 blocks of Convolutional Neural Networks with MaxPooling was used to achieve about 94% accuracy for training and about 74% accuracy for validation dataset which shows overfitting in the model.
- Same architecture with additional dropout layer and with data augmentation methods was used to achieve accuracy about 81% for both traing and validation dataset.
- There are two parts of VGG16 model, conv. base and fully connected neural networks. Conv. base of VGG16 model architecture with final weights was used. 96% accuracy for validation and training data achieved in 10 epochs.
