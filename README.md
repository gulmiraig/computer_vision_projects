1. MNIST dataset.
This is image classification project where Convolutional Neural Network are used.
Build a model that identifies the class of fashion article based on image.

2. CNN_binary_classification_VGG16 

To summary:

Training was done to small dataset: 2000 pictures belonging to 2 class: cats and dogs
Comparatively simple model where 4 blocks of Convolutional Neural Networks with MaxPooling was used to achieve about 94% accuracy for training and about 74% accuracy for validation dataset which shows overfitting in the model.
Same architecture with additional dropout layer and with data augmentation methods was used to achieve accuracy about 81% for both traing and validation dataset.
There are two parts of VGG16 model, conv. base and fully connected neural networks. Conv. base of VGG16 model architecture with final weights was used. 96% accuracy for validation and training data achieved in 10 epochs.
